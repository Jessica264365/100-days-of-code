# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 8th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Worked on my group project. Updated the FireStore rules and created the password reset component. 

**Thoughts:** The FireStore rules were a bit of a struggle because I only need to interact with the FireStore when a user is creating an account or signing in. Therefore I didn't need them to be as strict. I created rules that would not allow a user to type in an invalid email or a display name longer than 12 characters. That seemed to satisfy googles requirements.

### Day 2: March 9th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Just took some time to practice some algorithms on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) 

**Thoughts:** I thinkI will be signing myself up for the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms course. I feel like I need a bit more practice. I'm also thinking aobut creating a website to track my progress for these next 100 days. 

**Link to work:** Nothing to show today. I just practiced on LeetCode.

### Day 3: March 10th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Worked on small style changes for Panda Patter. I changed the color of the hamburger button on top. I continued to work on the password reset page for the application. I also started working on hiding the "Signup" link on the NavBar if the user is already logged in. 

**Thoughts:** I am currently working as a coffee shop manager and I have decided to quit to focus completely on coding and becoming career ready for the foreseeable future. I am looking forward to having more time to code. This way I won't be rushing 1 hour coding sessions in the evenings when I get home.
