# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 8th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Worked on my group project. Updated the FireStore rules and created the password reset component. 

**Thoughts:** The FireStore rules were a bit of a struggle because I only need to interact with the FireStore when a user is creating an account or signing in. Therefore I didn't need them to be as strict. I created rules that would not allow a user to type in an invalid email or a display name longer than 12 characters. That seemed to satisfy googles requirements.

### Day 2: March 9th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Just took some time to practice some algorithms on [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/) 

**Thoughts:** I thinkI will be signing myself up for the FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms course. I feel like I need a bit more practice. I'm also thinking aobut creating a website to track my progress for these next 100 days. 

**Link to work:** Nothing to show today. I just practiced on LeetCode.

### Day 3: March 10th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Worked on small style changes for Panda Patter. I changed the color of the hamburger button on top. I continued to work on the password reset page for the application. I also started working on hiding the "Signup" link on the NavBar if the user is already logged in. 

**Thoughts:** I am currently working as a coffee shop manager and I have decided to quit to focus completely on coding and becoming career ready for the foreseeable future. I am looking forward to having more time to code. This way I won't be rushing 1 hour coding sessions in the evenings when I get home.

### Day 4: March 11th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: I worked on getting buttons to display properly on one side of our flashcard app. We are going to create a increment and decrement system for the flashcards. The one the user gets incorrect most often will be displayed at the top of the page. 

**Thoughts:** I never used ternary operators this often until I started using React.

### Day 5: March 12th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: I worked on the routes and logic behind storing the current "correct" count of each flashcard in the database. Once it's completed the user will have the harder flashcards displayed more often for additional practice. I'm also starting to work on the password reset page again. I was distracted by the count storage in the database. I wanted to help my teammates debug it as quickly as possible. 

**Thoughts:** I have come to realize that creating a to-do list for projects is a must. I tend to skip around to different problems within the application. A to-do list has really helped me stay on track.

### Day 6: March 13th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I focused on LeetCode algorithms. I still want to take an algorithm course after I finish out my current two weeks at my job. I need more time to practice for sure. 

**Thoughts:** I'm thinking about trying a different algorithm website. I also want to start working on my own personal 100 days of code website. I would like to display the algorithms I'm working through and the solutions I found on the website.  

**Link to work:** I just worked on some algorithms on LeetCode. Therefore I do not have much to show. 

### Day 7: March 14th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Today I worked with my group to create a put route for our MongoDB database to store the current count of each card. I worked on grabbing the id of the specific card in the database. This way we can do "findByIdandUpdate" to update the current count of each card. 

**Thoughts:** I'm excited to get the "count" system for each card working so we can focus on small little UI/UX details before demo day.
