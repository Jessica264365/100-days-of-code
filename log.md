# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: March 8th, 2021


**Today's Progress**: Worked on my group project. Updated the FireStore rules and created the password reset component. 

**Thoughts:** The FireStore rules were a bit of a struggle because I only need to interact with the FireStore when a user is creating an account or signing in. Therefore I didn't need them to be as strict. I created rules that would not allow a user to type in an invalid email or a display name longer than 12 characters. That seemed to satisfy googles requirements.
